### 🚀 Explanation of the Code  
1. **Embedding Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` converts text into vector representations.  
2. **FAISS Index**: Stores document embeddings for fast similarity search.  
3. **Retrieval**: Finds the most relevant documents based on query similarity.  
4. **Text Generation**: Uses `FLAN-T5` to generate responses based on retrieved context.  
5. **Simple Query Execution**: Merges retrieved text and passes it as a prompt for response generation.

### 🚀 Steps to Run `simple_rag.py`

### 1️⃣ **Set Up a Python Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**  
It’s best to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.  

#### **For macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv rag-env
source rag-env/bin/activate
```
#### **For Windows (CMD or PowerShell):**
```bash
python -m venv rag-env
rag-env\Scripts\activate
```

---

### 2️⃣ **Install Required Dependencies**  
Run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:  
```bash
pip install faiss-cpu transformers sentence-transformers numpy
```
👉 If you're using a **GPU**, replace `faiss-cpu` with `faiss-gpu`:  
```bash
pip install faiss-gpu
```

---

### 3️⃣ **Create the Python File**  
Save the **`simple_rag.py`** script (from my previous response) in your project directory.

---

### 4️⃣ **Run the Script**  
Execute the script using:  
```bash
python simple_rag.py
```

---

### 5️⃣ **Check the Output**  
After running, you should see an output similar to:  
```bash
🔍 Query: What is RAG?
💡 Retrieved Documents: ['RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.', 'RAG combines retrieval and generation to improve response accuracy.']
📝 Generated Response: Context: RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. RAG combines retrieval and generation to improve response accuracy.
Question: What is RAG?
Answer: RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation and helps improve response accuracy.
```

### 🚀 **Next Steps & Enhancements**
✅ **Try Different Queries** and see how the model responds.  
✅ **Add More Documents** to improve retrieval accuracy.  
✅ **Use a More Powerful Model** like `google/flan-t5-large` for better text generation:  
```python
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="google/flan-t5-large")
```
✅ **Optimize Retrieval** by replacing FAISS with **ChromaDB or Pinecone** for more scalable vector storage.
