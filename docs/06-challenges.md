## 🚧 Challenges, Limitations, and Future of RAG

### 🔴 Challenges & Limitations
- **Latency Issues**: Retrieval step may slow down response time.
- **Dependency on Knowledge Base Quality**: Poor data leads to poor responses.
- **Security & Privacy Concerns**: Sensitive data exposure if not managed properly.
- **Complexity in Implementation**: Requires sophisticated retriever models and infrastructure.

### 🚀 Future of RAG
- 🔬 **Advancements in Retrieval Models**: Faster and more accurate search mechanisms.
- 🔄 **Hybrid RAG Models**: Combining different retrieval and generation strategies.
- 🌍 **Decentralized RAG Systems**: Privacy-preserving and federated learning-based retrieval systems.
- 🧠 **Integration with Multimodal AI**: Expanding RAG to work with images, videos, and other data formats.
