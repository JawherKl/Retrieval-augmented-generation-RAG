## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful framework that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge retrieval. 
Unlike traditional LLMs, which rely solely on pre-trained knowledge, RAG fetches relevant information from a knowledge source (such as databases or documents) to generate more accurate, context-aware, and up-to-date responses.

### Why Use RAG?
- âœ… **Overcomes Knowledge Cutoff**: Provides real-time and up-to-date information.
- âœ… **Improves Accuracy**: Reduces hallucinations by retrieving factual data.
- âœ… **Enhances Context Understanding**: Uses external knowledge to provide more detailed and specific responses.
- âœ… **Efficient Handling of Large Knowledge Bases**: Enables language models to access vast information without increasing model size.
