## 🔩 Components of RAG

1. **Retriever**: Finds relevant documents from an external source.
2. **Generator**: Uses a language model (e.g., GPT, LLaMA) to generate responses based on retrieved data.
3. **Knowledge Base**: A structured or unstructured data repository (e.g., databases, document stores, vector databases).
4. **Embedding Model**: Converts text into vector representations for efficient search and retrieval.
